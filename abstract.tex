This master's thesis studies the effects of a slotless, continuous metal cover of a mobile terminal on the performance of its antennas. Additionally, LTE MIMO antennas are designed together with GPS and Wi-Fi antennas.

The topic is studied by completing electromagnetic simulations. Specifications for the designed antennas are pre-defined, that correspond to today's standards. Also the simulation model of the mobile phone is pre-defined, and much more accurate than the ones used in earlier studies. The cellular antennas should operate on $704-960\,\mega\hertz$ and $1.71-2.69\,\giga\hertz$ with at least 30\,\% efficiency.

Additionally, matching circuits are designed for each antenna. Main challenge due to the metal-cover is obtaining sufficient and wideband matching. Regardless the challenging environment, all the designed antennas fulfil their requirements.
