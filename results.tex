\subsection{Fulfilment of objectives}
\label{sec:fulfilment}
In this thesis, it was defined to design two cellular antennas to operate on both $704-960\,\mega\hertz$ and $1.71-2.69\,\giga\hertz$ frequency ranges. Additionally, two antennas to support GPS and Wi-Fi connections should be designed. Moreover, each antenna should be matched to $-5\,\db$, and have a certain efficiency. The minimum efficiencies were $30\,\%$ for cellular and $40\,\%$ for other antennas. Also, the isolation between the two cellular antennas should be at least $-15\,\db$.
